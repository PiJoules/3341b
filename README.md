# Setting up Apache on Flask
Instructions on how to setup a flask application on an existing apache server.

## Dependencies
These instructions asume you are on a `Linux` OS on a `Bash` shell. These instructions also assume you have `python`, `vim` (or some other text editor), and `apache2` installed.

## Instructions
1) On your terminal, move to the directory `/var/www/`. This directory should exist if you have Apache installed. The existing `/var/www/html` directory can be ignored.
```sh
$ cd /var/www
```
